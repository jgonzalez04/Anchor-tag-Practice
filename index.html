        <p>I like Youtube because I watch videos that keep me entertained, there are a different variety of videos on there also.</p>
        <p>I like Netflix because personally, I'm a big movie person and netflix has a big amount of good movies.</p>
        <p>I like Flight Club because I'm a HUGE sneakerhead. I love buying sneakers, I might have a problem.</p>
        <p> I like Shein because it has a large amount of very cute clothes to choose from for a great price. I just love to shop, and of course I have to have outfits that go with my sneakers.</p>
